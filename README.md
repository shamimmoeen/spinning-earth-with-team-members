# Spinning Earth with Team Members

## Overview

This project showcases a visually engaging 3D spinning Earth with interactive hotspots representing team members' locations around the globe. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Live Server Requirement

To run this project locally, you'll need a live server environment. This is crucial because the project relies on relative paths for loading assets like textures and JavaScript files.

## Setting the Asset Path

Before running the project, ensure the `assetPath` value in index.html is correctly set according to your server URL. For example, if your project is hosted at http://localhost:8080/spinning-earth/, the assetPath should be /spinning-earth/.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and folders:

* index.html: The main HTML file containing the globe structure and JavaScript code.
* css/globe-custom.css: Custom CSS styles for the globe and hotspots.
* js/jquery.min.js: jQuery library for DOM manipulation (if required by Globe.js).
* js/globe.custom.js: Custom JavaScript code for globe configuration and interactions.
* textures/: Folder containing textures for the Earth map and hotspots (if applicable).

## Running the Project

Set up a live server within the project directory.
Adjust the assetPath in index.html if necessary.
Access the project in your web browser using the live server URL.
